## Abstract

v22 ("Convergence") consolidates the formal-verification advances of the May–June 2026 innovation
rounds into the canonical thesis line. Its central correction: the long-standing claim that axioms
A1–A4 force the weighted geometric mean is **false**. The asymmetric mean
Φ(x₁,x₂)=x₁^(2/3)·x₂^(1/3) satisfies A1–A4 yet differs from Λ, and fails permutation invariance.
We add **A5 (permutation invariance)** as a *structure field* on `LutarAxioms` — not a new axiom —
keeping the unique-axiom count at 14, and we report the *partial* closure of the n-dimensional
Cauchy functional-equation chain (topology + functional-analysis + symmetric branches) that, when
complete, would discharge Λ-uniqueness. **It is not complete on `main`; Λ therefore remains
Conjecture 1.** We additionally report: VCG mechanism truthfulness (dominant-strategy + individual
rationality, proven on branch), **SLSA L1 honest** build provenance (5/5 GHCR images cosign-signed, verifiable via `cosign verify`; L2 roadmap, not yet claimed), the Round 10–11 frontier formalizations (physics, quantum, CS,
crypto, distributed systems), and a **Sim-to-Real doctrine-transfer benchmark** modeled on the
Walrus physical foundation model that measures a mean doctrine α-gap of **0.10** across five unseen
compliance regimes. We claim only what is mechanically checked or empirically measured; everything
in review is labeled as such.

## 1. Where v22 sits in the lineage

v22 follows v21 ("The PURIQ-OS Substrate", 2026-06-01). It is **not** a new architecture; it is the
**convergence** of the mathematical-rigor work that v14–v21 deferred. See `THESIS_LINEAGE.md` for
the full v1 → v22 timeline. The v19 number was never released (intentional v18 → v20 jump).

## 2. Recent advances (the substance of v22)

### 2.1 A5 axiom merge — the A1–A4 uniqueness gap, corrected (MERGED, PR #148)

The historical "Theorem 1 — Λ is the unique aggregator under A1–A4" was **incorrect**. A literature
review of 13 published results on quasi-arithmetic and symmetric means confirms A1–A4 are
insufficient to force the geometric mean:

- Kolmogorov (1930) and Nagumo (1930) — quasi-arithmetic mean characterizations.
- Aczél (1948; 1966 Thm 5.1) — functional-equation route to means.
- Hardy, Littlewood & Pólya (1934) — *Inequalities*, power-mean family.
- Voorneveld (2008) — characterizations admitting asymmetric weights.

**Counterexample (verified):** Φ(x₁,x₂)=x₁^(2/3)·x₂^(1/3) satisfies homogeneity (A2), boundedness
(A4) and the remaining A1/A3 conditions, yet Φ ≠ Λ₂ and Φ(2,1)=2^(2/3) ≠ 2^(1/3)=Φ(1,2), so
permutation invariance fails.

**Fix (landed on `main` 2026-06-03 via PR #148):** add `IsPermutationInvariant` predicate and an
**A5 structure field** to `LutarAxioms`. `Lambda_A5_perm_invariant` is **sorry-free**
(`Equiv.prod_comp` / `Fintype.prod_equiv`). Because A5 is a structure field, the **unique-axiom
count stays 14**; the live corpus moves to 794 declarations / 14 unique axioms / 191 sorries
(measured `974e5e0c`, 2026-06-03 17:32Z).

### 2.2 The Cauchy_ND uniqueness chain — partial closure (IN REVIEW)

With A5 in place, Λ-uniqueness reduces to an n-dimensional Cauchy functional-equation chain:

| Branch | PR | Status | Note |
|---|----|--------|------|
| Topology (monotone → continuity bridge) | #175 | in review | Landed **TRUE forms**; refused to fake-prove |
| Functional analysis (`multiplicative_monotone_isPow`) | #173 | in review | Closed with **1 honest sorry** on the t=0 degenerate case |
| Symmetric (exponents αᵢ = 1/k) | #174 | in review | Closed **with A5 dependency** |

Combined: **A5 + Cauchy + topology + symmetric = the full Λ-uniqueness chain.** **This chain is
not yet complete on `main`** (three PRs open, one residual honest sorry). **Therefore Λ stays
Conjecture 1.** We will elevate Λ to Theorem 1 *only* when every Cauchy_ND sorry closes on `main`
and Lake CI is green.

### 2.3 VCG mechanism truthfulness (IN REVIEW, PR #172)

Both VCG sorries are closed on branch:
- `vcgDominantStrategyTruth` — truthful bidding is a dominant strategy.
- `vcgIndividualRationality` — participation never yields negative utility.

Proofs use Mathlib's `Finset.exists_max_image` and `add_sum_erase`. Pending merge of PR #172.

### 2.4 SLSA L1 honest build provenance

Build-provenance posture: **SLSA L1 honest**. All **5/5** flagship GHCR images
(a11oy, sentra, amaru, killinchu, rosie) are cosign-signed and verifiable via `cosign verify`.
L2 (isolated, attested build-service provenance) is roadmap via Wire D; **not yet claimed**.
**SLSA L3 not claimed** — requires hardened, isolated builders.

### 2.5 Innovation Rounds 10–11 (IN REVIEW / IN FLIGHT)

Round 10 instilled frontier formalizations into `lutar-lean` (all in review):
- **Physics (#177):** Noether's theorem, Liouville's theorem, Hamiltonian structure, entropy
  bounds, A5-from-gauge-symmetry.
- **Quantum (#176):** post-quantum signatures, Holevo bound, Kitaev, zero-knowledge, no-cloning→A5.
- **CS (#178):** Byzantine quorum intersection, FLP impossibility, CAP, pipeline latency, decidability.
- **Crypto (#179):** DSSE EUF-CMA, Rekor Merkle inclusion, Fulcio chain, BLS aggregation.
- **Distributed systems** (branch pushed, PR pending): linearizability, total order, failure
  detection, replay safety.
- **Round 9 anatomy (#170):** 7-organ Lean modules.

**Round 11 (formula frontier)** — "software-helping" formulas — is **in flight**.

### 2.6 Sim-to-Real doctrine transfer — Walrus parallel (DESIGN PAPER + PARTIAL EMPIRICAL)

Modeled on the Walrus physical foundation model (McCabe et al. 2025; Polymathic AI), we treat the
**locked doctrine kernel** (749/14/163 @ `c7c0ba17`) as a *pretraining prior* and a customer's
few-shot receipt set as *fine-tuning data*. We define the **doctrine α-gap** = |OOD verdict
accuracy − in-distribution verdict accuracy|.

On a live N=60 run against SZL's sentra (immune) and a11oy (policy) organs:

| Regime | Accuracy | α-gap |
|---|---|---|
| R0 control | 1.00 | — |
| R1 adversarial | 0.50 | 0.50 |
| R2 cross-jurisdictional | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| R3 multimodal | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| R4 temporal-drift | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| R5 low-data | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| **Mean** | — | **0.10** |

Four of five unseen regimes transfer perfectly; adversarial transfers only partially because the
immune organ uses a signature blocklist that catches known attacks but misses semantically novel
ones. We claim the architecture **admits** sim-to-real transfer — **not** that it matches the
downstream accuracy of physical foundation models. Full draft: `team/sim2real-compliance/PAPER_DRAFT.md`.

## 3. Doctrine attestation (verbatim)

- **Doctrine version:** v11 LOCKED (v11.1 in flight, post-A5).
- **Declarations:** 749 (pinned @ `c7c0ba17`); 794 post-A5 live.
- **Unique axioms:** **14** (unchanged by A5 — structure field).
- **Sorries:** 163 pinned (112 baseline + 51 Putnam); 191 post-A5 live.
- **Λ status:** **Conjecture 1 — NOT a theorem.**
- **Supply chain:** **SLSA L1 honest** (cosign-signed, verifiable via `cosign verify`); L2 roadmap, not yet claimed; L3 not claimed.
- **Section 889 vendors:** Huawei, ZTE, Hytera, Hikvision, Dahua (exactly 5).
- No Iron Bank / FedRAMP / CMMC L2+ / SWFT / Mission-Owner claims (none held, none pursued).

---

## 4. Honest posture (carried from v21, updated)

- Λ-aggregator uniqueness is **Conjecture 1**, conditional on the Cauchy_ND chain closing.
- A5 is a **structure field**, not a new axiom; axiom count remains 14.
- Reed–Solomon ≠ holographic. Event-sourcing ≠ time travel. Physics analogies are scaffolding.
- Quechua organ names are **brand naming**, not prior-art or cultural claims. No mystical claims.
- In-review PRs (#170, #172–#179) are labeled as such and are **not** presented as landed theorems.
