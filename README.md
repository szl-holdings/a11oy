> Vertical alignment substrate — policy, measurement, knowledge, and QEC-integrity packages for governed AI execution


> **Frontier Capability:** Governed execution fabric aligned to the Ouroboros Thesis v18.0 DOI and Lean proof substrate. Runtime claims are tracked through the A11oy Doctrine Build, deploy payload manifests, and the public-claim contract in [`docs/PROVENANCE.md`](docs/PROVENANCE.md).

`a11oy` (Alloy) is the governed agentic execution fabric of SZL Holdings — the seven-layer substrate that connects live enterprise signals to human-confirmed decisions with cryptographic proof at every transition. It provides TypeScript packages for policy enforcement, signal measurement, knowledge-graph traversal, and QEC-integrity verification across all SZL domain verticals.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository ships the core fabric packages consumed by [`szl-holdings/platform`](https://github.com/szl-holdings/platform). The deployment surface for Alloy is the platform monorepo; this repo contains the standalone alignment substrate packages.

## Packages

| Package | Purpose | Key Types |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `packages/policy` | Covenant Policy Engine — evaluates all actions against governance rules before execution | `CovenantPolicy`, `ApprovalGate`, `PolicyDecision` |
| `packages/measurement` | Signal scoring, PRISM correlation, baseline drift detection | `SignalScore`, `PRISMFrame`, `DriftReport` |
| `packages/knowledge` | Knowledge-graph traversal and domain ontology queries | `KnowledgeGraph`, `OntologyQuery`, `DomainNode` |
| `packages/qec-integrity` | Quantum-error-correction lineage verification (CSS-QEC backed by `lutar-lean`) | `QECLineage`, `IntegrityProof`, `CSSVector` |
| `packages/receipt-substrate` | Operational MCP-style tool-envelope receipts with hash-chain verification and JSONL append flow | `ToolEnvelope`, `OperationalReceipt`, `verifyChain` |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install via npm
npm install @szl-holdings/a11oy-policy
npm install @szl-holdings/a11oy-measurement

# Or with pnpm
pnpm add @szl-holdings/a11oy-policy

# Development (clone + workspace)
git clone https://github.com/szl-holdings/a11oy.git
cd a11oy
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run test
```

---

## Operational artifacts

| Artifact | Purpose | Validation |
|----------|---------|------------|
| `packages/receipt-substrate` | MCP/Cursor/Claude-style operational receipts and JSONL chain verification | `npm test --prefix packages/receipt-substrate` |
| `artifacts/a11oy-uds` | UDS/Zarf payload tree with manifest and attestation generation | `A11OY_UDS_ALLOW_SOURCE_FALLBACK=1 bash artifacts/a11oy-uds/scripts/build.sh` |

The UDS build preserves release-grade behavior when `tsc`, `zarf`, `zstd`, and
`cosign` are installed. In minimal cloud environments, explicit source fallback
emits a non-Zarf deterministic tar plus manifest and attestation checks so the
operator flow remains testable without pretending to produce a deployable Zarf
package.

---

## How It Works

Every action in the SZL platform must pass through the policy engine before execution:

1. **Signal ingress** — `measurement` scores incoming events against PRISM baselines
2. **Knowledge context** — `knowledge` retrieves relevant domain ontology for explanation
3. **Policy evaluation** — `policy` checks the action against Covenant Policy rules
4. **Approval gate** — if policy requires human approval, `policy` creates an `ApprovalGate`
5. **Execution unlock** — only after gate resolution does the action proceed
6. **Operational receipts** — `receipt-substrate` emits and verifies tool-call receipts for MCP/Cursor/Claude-style operations
7. **QEC verification** — `qec-integrity` verifies proof-chain cryptographic lineage

The Λ-invariant (lambda axis) constrains the policy evaluation: no recommendation with confidence below the configured threshold proceeds to the approval gate without escalation.

## Security and Governance

- OpenSSF Scorecard: **7.0** (as of 2026-05-28) — see [scorecard report](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/szl-holdings/a11oy)
- CodeQL security scanning on every push to main
- All packages are consumed exclusively via the platform governance layer; no direct external API surface
- QEC-integrity lineage is formally verified in [`szl-holdings/lutar-lean`](https://github.com/szl-holdings/lutar-lean)

## What a11oy Is NOT

Doctrine v6 requires honest scoping. a11oy is:

- **Not a general-purpose AI runtime.** It is a governed execution fabric specific to the SZL domain verticals.
- **Not a replacement for human review.** Approval gates require human confirmation; the fabric enforces this, not bypasses it.
- **Not an autonomous agent.** a11oy provides substrate for bounded-recursion agents governed by Ouroboros; it does not ship an agent loop itself.
- **Not production-ready as a standalone service.** The deployment surface is `szl-holdings/platform`; these packages are consumed as a library.
- **Not formally verified end-to-end.** QEC-integrity proofs live in `lutar-lean`; the TypeScript packages implement the checked contracts but are not the proof artifacts.
